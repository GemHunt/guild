** Release versioning

We use http://semver.org/

We'll stay on 0.x.y for the forseeable future.

Our first release will be 0.1.0.

Our "public API" includes a number of contracts, which will be
described in this documentation.

For the time being our releases will include timestamp values as
metadata. Timestamps will be in the format ~YYMMDD.BUILD~. ~BUILD~ is
a monotonically incrementing build number.

E.g. this would represent version ~0.0.0~ that was built on Sept 13,
2016 and was the 6th overall build.

: 0.0.0+160913.6

  performance

** Privacy topics

We're collecting information about a system, which could be considered
confidential. We need to document that information and provide a way
for the user to filter that on export.
