# Getting started

Guild is software that you run locally to prepare, train, and evaluate
models. It only takes a few minutes to install and start using it.

## Requirements

Guild runs on Linux and Mac OS systems. Windows is not supported at
this time. If you're running Windows, you can install and run Guild
within a Linux virtual machine running on your system.

The precompiled packages below are self contained and do not require
additional software. However, to train models you need to have the
applicable Deep Learning software installed and configured on your
systems.

Refer to these setup guides for the applicable software.
