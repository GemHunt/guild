# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why another deep learning project?

Guild AI is not a deep learning framework -- it's a set of tools to
enable collaboration on deep learning projects.

Deep learning models have enormous compute requirements for training
and inference. It's important to understand how your models perform
for a number of reasons:

- The faster you can train, the sooner you get feedback about what
  works well and what doesn't

- There's more to model development than getting high accuracies --
  it's important to understand how a model performs in various
  operating environments

- Selecting the right model architecture is often a matter of making
  performance trade offs, sometimes sacrificing accuracy for
  efficiency

In addition to collecting model performance statsitics, Guild collects
system statistics. This lets you compare training and inference
performance across different models, architectures, datasets, hyper
parameters and system configurations.

Once you've collected this important information, Guild lets you
publish it for others to benefit from.

## What's the fastest way to learn Guild?

Guild is a simple toolset and you can start getting value in just a
few minutes. The fastest way to get started is to follow along
in [Getting Started](getting-started.md).

## How much does it cost to use Guild?

Guild AI is freely available under
the
[Apache 2 open source license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guildai/guild-client/master/LICENSE). Of
course you'll need to invest some time to learn Guild -- but it's easy!
